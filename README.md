#   OList Clone With Beautifulsoup And Django
This is a small clone of some parts of the *OList Nigeria Marketplace*.
This was achieved using **beautifulsoup4** for *web scraping* and **Django**.
The sole purpose of this is to enhance my comprehension on web scraping and effective use of the django framework.
This may not be as good as other projects as i'm just a beginner in django and python at large.
